* Summary

A bit overkill package for creating *equations* and *bullet points*, suitable for
PowerPoint, Impress, Inkscape, etc...

I consider it overkill because it uses the [[https://root.cern.ch/][CERN ROOT]] library for [[https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTLatex.html][LaTex]] expressions,
or [[https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTMathText.html][MathText]] for a more tradition form of equations.

I started using ROOT during my graduation, and I always liked producing equations with
it for projects, reports, and small students presentations.

This package is designed to be easy and ready to use when needed, and it also exports to
~svg~, which can be included in *Inkscape*.

* Requirements
+ [[https://root.cern.ch/][CERN ROOT]]
+ [[https://gtkmm.gnome.org/en/][GTKmm3]] (C++ interface for GTK)

* Installation
To build the package first make the =build.sh= script executable, and run the application.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  chmod +x build.sh
  ./build.sh
#+END_SRC

If the script is executed without error, you can launch it as:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./latex-equation
#+END_SRC

** Make the executable system-wide
Copy the executable to =/usr/local/bin= to run it from anywhere.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo cp latex-equation /usr/local/bin
#+END_SRC

And run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  latex-equation
#+END_SRC
